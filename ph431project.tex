\section*{Background}
Optical vortices have been shown to possess unique characteristics which make them potentially useful in a number of different applications. An optical vortices, or a light beam containing a ``screw dislocations," is a light wave with a helical structure such that perfect destructive interference occurs at its center, forming a node$^{1}$. When projected onto a surface, an optical vortex will appear as a ring of light with a dark node at its center. The structure and appearance of an optical vortex are shown in Figure 1 below.

A comprehensive paper in 1974 by Nye and Berry$^{2}$ summarized the theory for the different experimentally-observed dislocations that can be induced in light wave trains, including screw dislocations. An extraordinary characteristic of optical vortices is the photons in the beams carry a conserved orbital angular momentum around the beam's center that is independent of the photons' intrinsic angular momentum. Information can thus be carried in two independent and distinct channels in an optical vortex. The helical shape of the beam can also exert torques when focused onto objects. Accordingly, these beams can be useful for applications in secure communication, particle traps referred to as ``optical tweezers," and in quantum computing.
